# Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse Web AR Game!

On the cutting edge of tech, I had the pleasure of collaborating with Sony Pictures for the DVD/BluRay Release of Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse. Working with 8the Wall I developed an AR experience direct from a mobile browser, no native app required! The QR code for this experience was put on every DVD sold in a Walmart.

## Languages and Frameworks

8th Wall, AFRAME, Three.js, Javascript, HTML/CSS. (The source code is not available due to IP protection)
